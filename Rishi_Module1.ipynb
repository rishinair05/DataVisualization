To achieve this, we use conditional statements. `if` statements work on the basis of booleans, if the boolean (ie the condition) is True, then the code under `if` runs, otherwise we move on to `if` counterpart - `else`. A good way to read the code is:\n","\n","`if condition:`\n","\n","        ....run this code....\n","`else:`\n","\n","        ....run this code....\n","\n","An `else` is not always necessary, but in case present and condition in front of `if` is False, then code inside `else` will automatically run. \n","\n","Sometimes you need more conditions for the same problem (as in the example below), then you use an `elif`, short for `else if`. Syntax will be:\n","\n","`if condition:`\n","\n","        ....run this code....\n","\n","`elif condition:`\n","\n","        ....run this code....\n","    \n","`else:`\n","\n","        ....run this code....\n","\n","\n","You can also put if statements inside if statements!
