Object Oriented Programming language or OOP language is a type of programming language based on the idea of something called **objects**. Objects are anything that contain data OR code. So a variable is an object, so is a function. Objects store the data in their specific properties called *attributes* and code in their built-in functions called *methods*. Every data type that we studied on Tuesday is a `class` object. In this notebook, we will take a further look into making our own funtions and classes. "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ymBvXQm_f4Z_"},"source":["## Functions\n","\n","Till now, we have been using built-in python functions. Most of the times we need certain pieces of code to repeat at certain places so loops are not the asnwer for that. Programming languages allow us to create our own functions, that can be called anytime anywhere in the code once made. Let's look at the syntax:\n","\n","`def (function_name) (parameter_1, parameter_2,.......parameter_n):`\n","        \n","        `'''`\n","        \n","        docstrings\n","        \n","        `'''`\n","        \n","        ....code here....\n","\n","`function_name` is chosen by you, the coder. Parameters are the inputs that we provide to function. They act as local variables for the functions and will not affect anything outside the function. The number of parameters depends entirely on what you wish for your function to do. You can also set your parameter values to a default by making the following change:\n","\n","`def (function_name) (parameter_1 = default_1, parameter_2 = default_2 ........)`\n","\n","Make sure all the parameters that do not have a default value are placed first. If you wish that the parameter does not have the default value, you can change it when you call the function in your code BUT your function WILL work if you do not mention it.\n","\n","`return` statement is another thing you will notice in functions. Function can either return a value/data or return nothing. if you function has a `return` statement, it will be returning some proessed data type like the one in the example below. Functions that do not return anything are also very common. `print()` is the best example of a function that does not return anything.  \n","\n","`docstrings` are comments that give a brief description of the function. In a clean code, every function has its docstrings that explains what kind of input the function is taking, what kind of output it will return and what the function does. It does not need to be very detailed. Look at the following example where we make a function of our previous code."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"VNWWggPidPCY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1625603177318,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":224,"user":{"displayName":"Abhay Verma","photoUrl":"","userId":"17737904775781474183"}},"outputId":"fb714e9a-0e48-407d-c005-cf8141865ed7"},"source":["# Function example\n","\n","# None is an object of data type NoneType \n","# It is used to represent an empty variable, containing no kind of data whatsoever\n","def grading (score = None):\n"," '''\n"," (int/float) -> (str)\n"," Returns the grade based on the score received\n"," '''\n"," if score and score >= 0 and score <= 100:\n","    if score > 90:\n","      return 'A+'\n","    elif score > 80:\n","      return 'A'\n","    elif score > 75:\n","      return 'B+'\n","    elif score > 70:\n","      return 'B'\n","    elif score > 65:\n","      return 'C+'\n","    elif score > 60:\n","      return 'C'\n","    elif score > 40:\n","      return 'D'\n","    else:\n","      return 'F'\n"," else:\n","    print('score unavailable')\n","\n","# Calling the function\n","grade = grading()\n","print(grade)\n","grade = grading(98)\n","print(grade)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["score unavailable\n","None\n","A+\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"JqYomKgbgWUS","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1628183908130,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":140,"user":{"displayName":"Rishi Nair","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjS1B_wFXU1azywHf8be0DZsVlciX1Z3h4vI2F15g=s64","userId":"13299941535799148195"}},"outputId":"ec671f82-1175-4a43-8f69-43530508fb8d"},"source":["## PRACTICE EXERCISE ##\n","# Write a function called \"countDuplicates()\" that takes in a dictionary as an \n","# input and RETURNS a list of values that appear 2 or 4 times.

This means that all the data types that you learnt are something called **Classes**. Consider each class as a new data type. OOP languages allow users to create their own classes and hence their own data type. Each class has their specific functions (eg `list.append()` for `list()`) that are unique to their own class. These functions are called *methods*. In OOP, information within the class is stored in *attributes*. Consider attributes to be local variables for the whole class. They can be used in any method and are what we usually seek in a class.\n","\n","In this class, we will show how you can make your own class and how you can use it. First, let's get familiar with the syntax:\n","\n","`class (class_name):`\n","\n","        def __init__(self, parameter_1 = defualt_1, parameter_2 = default_2 .......):\n","            self.parameter_1 = parameter_1\n","            self.parameter_2 = parameter_2\n","            .\n","            .\n","            .\n","    \n","        def __str__(self):\n","            return (string version of self variables in the way you want)\n","\n","        def (method_name) (self, method_para_1 = method_default_1 ........):\n","            ....code here....\n","\n","`self` is an instance of the class, ie, it allows you to access all the attributes and methods of the class just by using self. \n","\n","You can define as many methods for a class as you want with as many parameters as you want. The first two methods mentioned are most important, especially the first one as it is needed in every class. Make sure to write `self` as the first parameter to access all the other methods and attributes of the class inside the method you are creating.\n","\n","`__init__` is short for initialize. This method literally initializes your class, assigns values to the different attributes of the class based on either the input received (the parameters) or itself. You can also have attributes that can never be changed via a parameter. For example if I say: `self.parameter_1 = default_1` instead of what is written, self.parameter_1 can never be changed. All the parameters defined in `__init__` are attributes of the class that can be accessed in any method using self.\n","\n","`__str__` is a method that is useful only if you wish that `print()` function works for your data type. `print()` will look for `__str__` method in your class and whatever you are returning there will be printed. Make sure the information you are returning is of data type `str`.\n","\n","Now, let's look at an example for a class and see its working."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"auzzO67lgF5V","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1625773610782,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":135,"user":{"displayName":"Abhay Verma","photoUrl":"","userId":"17737904775781474183"}},"outputId":"4329a55c-a21a-4c68-d5fc-db36ca45e035"},"source":["# Making a class for a 2D point\n","class Point:\n","  \n","  # Initialising the class attributes, x and y\n","  def __init__(self, x = 0, y = 0):\n","    self.x = x\n","    self.y = y\n","\n","  # Method for calculating the distance of the point from origin\n","  def distance_from_origin(self):\n","    '''\n","    (None) -> (float)\n","    Returns the distance of the point from the origin\n","    '''\n","    return ((self.x)**2 + self.y**2)**0.5\n","\n","  # To print the point data type using print() function\n","  def __str__(self):\n","    return '(' + str(self.x) + ',' + str(self.y) +')'\n","\n","  # To find the midpoint between the given point and target point\n","  def midpoint (self, target):\n","    '''\n","    (Point) -> (Point)\n","    Given a target point, this function returns the midpoint between the original Point and target Point \n","    '''\n","    midx = (self.x + target.x)/2\n","    midy = (self.y + target.y)/2\n","    return Point(midx, midy)\n","\n","# making a point using default values\n","origin = Point()\n","print(origin)\n","print(origin.distance_from_origin())\n","\n","\n","# Creating a target point to test the midpoint function\n","new = Point(10,10)\n","print(origin.midpoint(new))\n","print(new.midpoint(origin))\n","# Note that the function is coded such a way that it can be used in both ways!"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["(0,0)\n","0.0\n","(5.0,5.0)\n","(5.0,5.0)\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"GsLxp6qFWSpx","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1628186600226,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":4311,"user":{"displayName":"Rishi Nair","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjS1B_wFXU1azywHf8be0DZsVlciX1Z3h4vI2F15g=s64","userId":"13299941535799148195"}},"outputId":"97ad0f56-8d12-42d4-8e4c-06e6e10f8663"},"source":["import math \n","## PRACTICE EXERCISE ##\n","# Create a class called \"Parallelogram\".
